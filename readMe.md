**How to run:**

**Controls Usage:**

**Master Volume:** sets the volume of the final sound. \
**Master reset:** resets all the values of all sliders and note options. This will reset to whatever you began with.

**Low-pass Filter control:** \
Set the cutoff frequency to the desired frequency which will attenuate anything above the user-defined threshold.

**Oscillator Mixer:** \
Sine Wave: Set the amplitude/gain of the Sine Wave to pass through to mixer \
Square Wave: Set the amplitude/gain of the Square Wave to pass through to mixer \
Triangle Wave: Set the amplitude/gain of the Triangle Wave to pass through to mixer \
Sawtooth Wave: Set the amplitude/gain of the Sawtooth Wave to pass through to mixer

**ADSR Envelope:**
Attack time: Set the Attack time to the desired time which will tune the synthesizer up to 100% volume \
Decay Time: Sound decreases until it hits the sustain level \
Sustain Time: Time the sustain stage sustains the amplitude at user-defined value resulting from decay stage.

**LFO - (Low Frequency Oscillator):**
Vibrato Amount: Ranges from 0 to 100% sets the depth of the vibrato which modulates the pitch of the sound wave.\
Vibrato Speed: Ranges from 0 to 30 Hz, sets how fast the pitch variation occurs with 30 Hz indication a rapid flutter and low values being a slow warble.\
Tremolo Amount: Ranges from 0 to 100% sets the amount of tremolo effect which modulates the amplitude volume. \
Tremolo Speed: Ranges from 0 to 15 Hz, speed of the tremolo effect in Hz, which determines how quickly the amplitude changes.

**Delay:** \
Delay Time: Controls the delay interval before the echo is heard, ranging from 0 to 1 second. Setting this parameter adjusts the time gap between the original signal and its delayed replica. \
Delay Feedback: Determines how much of the delayed signal is fed back into the delay input, creating repeated echoes. The range is from 0% (no echoes) to 100% (maximum echo repetition). Adjusting this value influences the number of repetitions and the duration of the echo effect. \
Delay Amount: Specifies the volume of the delayed signal in relation to the original, ranging from 0% (no delay effect) to 100% (all signal is delayed). This controls the balance between the original (dry) and delayed (wet) signals, allowing for a subtle to pronounced delay effect."

**Synthesizer Keyboard:**
After setting desired controls, press any of the synthesizer keyboard keys which will play the displayed octave of the note.

**Siren/Melody generator:**
Select the desired note from the list of note frequencies for each note.
Then adjust the tempo to the desired beats per minute.
Start will begin the melody/siren and stop will stop it.
You can also choose to press the Siren button which will provide an example of an emergency siren which can be a real world application of this synthesizer.
